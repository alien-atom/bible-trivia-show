PRD: Bible Trivia Grid Game (BTS-Game)
1. Product Overview
Goal: Build a web-based, multiplayer Bible trivia game using Replit. The game utilizes a Jeopardy-style grid where questions are categorized by difficulty and point value.
Target Audience: Groups, Sunday schools, or bible study circles.
Core Stack: Python (Flask/Django) or Node.js, HTML/CSS/JS, Replit Database (or simple JSON storage).
2. Game Setup & User Flow
Phase 1: Initialization (Step 1)
 * Landing Page: A simple setup screen.
 * Inputs Required:
   * Number of Players: Integer input.
   * Player Identities: Dynamic text fields to enter Names or Nicknames for each player.
   * Game Length: Input for "Number of Rounds" to play.
 * Action: "Start Game" button initializes the Grid and sets Player 1 as the active player.
Phase 2: The Grid (Step 2)
 * Visual Layout: The board is a Grid containing 6 Columns.
 * Grid Data Structure: Based on the source document, the grid must be rendered as follows:
| Column Type | Difficulty | Category | Color Code | Row 1 Pts | Row 2 Pts | Row 3 Pts | Row 4 Pts | Row 5 Pts |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Col 1 | Easy | Beginner | White | 1-10 | 11-20 | 21-30 | 31-40 | 41-50 |
| Col 2 | Easy | Beginner | White | 51-70 | 71-90 | 91-110 | 111-130 | 131-150 |
| Col 3 | Medium | Intermediate | Blue | 151-180 | 181-210 | 211-240 | 241-270 | 271-300 |
| Col 4 | Medium | Intermediate | Blue | 301-340 | 341-380 | 381-420 | 421-460 | 461-500 |
| Col 5 | Hard | Expert | Orange | 501-550 | 551-600 | 601-650 | 651-700 | 701-750 |
| Col 6 | Hard | Expert | Orange | 751-810 | 811-870 | 871-930 | 931-990 | 991-1050 |
 * Display Logic: Each tile on the grid should display a specific point value chosen from the allocated range (e.g., for Col 1/Row 1, display "10").
 * Status Indicators: Tiles change state once played (e.g., grayed out or disabled).
Phase 3: Gameplay Mechanics (Step 3)
 * Turn Indication: The UI clearly highlights whose turn it is (e.g., "Current Player: John").
 * Selection: The active player clicks a tile on the grid.
 * Question Modal: A popup appears displaying:
   * The Category and Point Value.
   * The Question (derived from Bible verses, chapters, or books).
   * Hidden Answer (visible only to a game master or validated by system input).
 * Answer Handling:
   * Correct: Player gets the points added to their score. The modal closes. Turn passes to next player.
   * Incorrect (The Steal):
     * Points are not awarded to the current player.
     * Steal Trigger: The system prompts: "Wrong Answer! Opportunity to Steal."
     * An opponent can be selected to answer. If they get it right, they win the points.
 * Round Tracking: The system tracks the number of questions played.
Phase 4: Game Over (Step 4)
 * Trigger: The game ends when the input "Number of Rounds" is reached OR all tiles are cleared.
 * Result Screen:
   * Display a leaderboard sorted by total score.
   * Highlight the Winner with a "Victory" animation/message.
   * "Play Again" button.
3. Technical Requirements
A. Data Model (JSON Structure)
The application needs a database of questions mapped to the categories in the source file. Use the following JSON schema:
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "book": "Genesis",
    "verse": "1:1",
    "question": "What is the first sentence of the Bible?",
    "answer": "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "category": "Beginner",
    "points_range": "1-10",
    "assigned_points": 10
  }
]

B. UI/UX Styling
 * Color Palette: Strictly adhere to the source document for the columns:
   * Beginner Columns: White background (Card text must be dark).
   * Intermediate Columns: Blue background (Card text white).
   * Expert Columns: Orange background (Card text white/black for contrast).
 * Responsiveness: The Grid should scale to fit the screen; on mobile devices, columns may stack or scroll horizontally.
C. Logic Constraints
 * Randomization: If there are more questions in the database than slots on the grid, the system must randomly assign questions to the appropriate Difficulty/Point slots at game start.
 * Point Parsing: The system must accept the ranges (e.g., "151-180") and assign a specific integer value for the score calculation (e.g., 150).
4. Feature Checklist for Developer
 * [ ] Create Player Input Form.
 * [ ] Build Grid Generator dynamically based on the 6 columns defined in BTS-Game-Sheet.
 * [ ] Implement logic to differentiate columns by Color (White, Blue, Orange).
 * [ ] Implement Scoreboard (persistent on screen).
 * [ ] Implement "Steal" logic (button to switch active answerer).
 * [ ] Create "Game Over" summary logic.
Would you like me to generate the code for the JSON question database (with some sample Bible questions) so you can upload that file to Replit immediately?
