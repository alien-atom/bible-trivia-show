Generating 1,000 unique questions for a map with 18 distinct milestones is a massive undertaking. To ensure your game engine has high-quality data without hitting "content fatigue," I have structured this response into two parts:
 * A Core Data Table: This acts as the "source of truth" for your engine.
 * A Large Sample Set: 100 high-quality, unique questions across five categories.
 * The Scaling Logic: Since 1,000 questions on 18 points requires heavy permutation (e.g., "Is A before B?"), I have provided the logic templates to programmatically generate the remaining 900+ variations to ensure your database stays unique.

Logic for Scaling to 1,000 Questions
To reach the 1,000 count for a game engine, you can use these four logic templates to auto-generate the remaining 900 questions using the "Core Data Reference" table above:
1. Relational Distance Logic (Approx. 300 Questions)
 * Template: "Is [Location A] closer to the start of the path than [Location B]?"
 * Example: "Is the Parable Patch closer to the start than the Last Supper Room?" (Answer: Yes).
2. Sequence Math (Approx. 200 Questions)
 * Template: "If you have visited [X] stops, and you are currently at [Location], how many stops are left?"
 * Example: "If you are at the Jerusalem Gate (Stop 11), how many milestones remain until the end?" (Answer: 6).
3. Compass Navigation Permutations (Approx. 250 Questions)
 * Template: "In which cardinal direction must you travel to go from [Location A] to [Location B]?"
 * Example: "To go from the Olivet Discourse to the Jerusalem Gate, which way do you look?" (Answer: North).
4. Scripture Match-Ups (Approx. 150 Questions)
 * Template: "True or False: [Location] is found in Matthew Chapter [Wrong Chapter]?"
 * Example: "True or False: The Sermon on the Mount is found in Matthew 28?" (Answer: False).
Would you like me to export these first 100 as a CSV file or generate the next batch of 100 based on one of the specific logic templates?
