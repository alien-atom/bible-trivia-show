2026-02-08T19:35:34.223Z	(!) Some chunks are larger than 500 kB after minification. Consider:
2026-02-08T19:35:34.223Z	- Using dynamic import() to code-split the application
2026-02-08T19:35:34.223Z	- Use build.rollupOptions.output.manualChunks to improve chunking: https://rollupjs.org/configuration-options/#output-manualchunks
2026-02-08T19:35:34.223Z	- Adjust chunk size limit for this warning via build.chunkSizeWarningLimit.
